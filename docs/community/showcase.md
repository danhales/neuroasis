- Educational materials based on these approaches

## Featured Projects

*This section will be populated as community members share their work.*

### Template Example: Collaborative Text Editor

**Created by:** Example User

**Description:** A browser-based application that allows writers to collaborate with AI on creative writing projects, using a structured approach to revision and ideation.

**How it's connected:** Built on the prompt engineering patterns from the Vector Drawing App, but applied to text-based collaboration instead of visual work.

**Key insight:** "We discovered that the turn-taking approach works even better for text, and developed a new pattern for handling narrative consistency across multiple exchanges."
