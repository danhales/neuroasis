# AI-Human Collaborative Exploration

Welcome to a repository dedicated to exploring the possibilities of AI-human collaboration through practical projects. This is an experimental garden where we plant seeds of collaborative methods and watch what grows.

## Philosophy

This repository is built on the principle of exploration. Rather than prescribing specific outcomes or tightly controlling how our work evolves, we're interested in discovering the diverse ways AI and humans can collaborate effectively. We've chosen the MIT License to maximize the possibilities for experimentation while encouraging a community that values sharing improvements and insights.

We believe that by creating flexible, well-documented starting points and encouraging diverse applications, we can learn more about the potential of human-AI partnerships than by enforcing a specific approach.

## Projects

Each project in this repository represents a collaborative experiment between humans and AI assistants:

- [Vector Drawing App](./projects/vector-drawing-app/): A web-based application that facilitates sketch exchanges between humans and AI using a lightweight vector format.
- [Future projects will be listed here as they grow]

## Getting Involved

We welcome contributions and adaptations in many forms:

1. **Try a collaboration**: Use our CONTRIBUTING.md as a template to start your own AI-human collaborative project.
2. **Share your experience**: Document how you've adapted our approaches in your own work.
3. **Contribute improvements**: Submit pull requests to enhance existing projects.
4. **Showcase derivatives**: Tell us about projects inspired by this work, even if they've gone in completely different directions.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidance on participation.

## Community Showcase

We're creating a collection of community adaptations and experiments built on this work. If you've created something inspired by these projects, we'd love to feature it here! See the [Community Showcase](./docs/community/showcase.md) for examples and submission guidelines.

## Learning Resources

- [Prompt Engineering Patterns](./docs/prompt-engineering/patterns.md): Reusable patterns discovered through our projects
- [Collaboration Workflows](./docs/tutorials/collaboration-workflows.md): Step-by-step guides for effective AI-human teamwork
- [Project-Specific Documentation](./projects/): Each project contains its own detailed documentation

## License

This repository is available under the [MIT License](./LICENSE), which gives you the freedom to use, modify, and distribute the code with minimal restrictions. We've chosen this license to encourage the widest possible range of explorations and applications while asking only that you acknowledge the original work.

We're excited to see what grows from these seeds!
